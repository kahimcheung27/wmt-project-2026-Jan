# Walmart Revenue Analysis & Predictive Modeling
**Proejct Overwiew:**

A data-driven financial analysis leveraging **Python** and **Excel** to extract and clean the financial datasets from Wharton Research Data Services (**WRDS**) database and official Financial earnings report. This project simulates **Big 4 Financial Due Diligence** engagement, evaluating Walmart's performance against industry competitors to provide objective strategic recommendations.

**Objectives:**
  - **Performance Benchmarking:** Investigate Walmart's competitive position using automated financial ratio analysis
  - **Revenue Driver Identification**: Analyze specific key variables (Ecommerce and Advertising revenue) to find out Walmart's revenue drivers
  - **Strategic Simulation:** Perform objective data analysis and report the insights similar to professional **Advisory and Consulting** reports

**Technical skills used:**
  - **Data Extraction:** Excel (from WRDS database and official Financial earnings report)
  - **Data Cleaning:** Python (Pandas)
  - **Data Analysis and Statistical Modeling:** Python (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) (perform linear regression analysis and revenue forecasting)
  - **Data Visualisation:** Power BI (create interactive dashboards for presentation)
  - **Spreadsheet Automation:** Python (Pandas, XlsxWriter) (automate the calculation of financial ratios and Excel spreadsheets professional report formatting)

**Key findings and recommendations:**
| Findings | Recommendations |
| -------- | -------- |
| Significant growth in Advertising revenue in FY 2026 | Focus on investing in emerging technologies to improve consumer experience |
| Consistent Ecommerce penetration and Sales growth  | Further expand Walmart's ecommerce market to increase the ecommerce market shares |
| Increasing current liabilities and expenses | Implement stricter management on liabilities and costs to mitigate the risk |

**Strategic Conclusion:**

Walmart should adopt a **risk-adverse Ecommerce expansion strategy** together with **rigorous liabilities and expenses management**. While advertising and ecommerce revenue is strong, the increasing trend in current liabilities poses a potential liquidity risk. **Comprehensive expenditure tracking** is recommended to maintain the profit margins when the Ecommerce business in Walmart matures.
